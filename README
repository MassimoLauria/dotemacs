This is the Emacs config of Massimo Lauria (C) 2009-2016.

This file is under massive and continue change, and things break every
day. I just put it online so you can cut & paste whatever you may find
useful.

This configuration assume  a modern Emacs installation,  and uses Cask
pacakge  system.  If  your  Emacs   is  less  recent  than  that,  the
configuration will revert to a minimal version.
