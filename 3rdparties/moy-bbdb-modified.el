;;; Commentary:

;; This file has been written and tested for use with Gnus. However, I
;; didn't use specific features from Gnus, and this should be able to
;; run without any modification for any other Emacs mailer.  It is
;; known to run on Gnus 5.8, Oort Gnus. I have been told that it
;; didn't work for VM. If you use it with VM, then, please, inform me.
;;
;; Usage : put the following code in your .emacs (.gnus.el or .gnus if
;; you use Gnus)
;;
;; | (autoload 'bbdb/send-hook "moy-bbdb"
;; |   "Function to be added to `message-send-hook' to notice records when sending messages" t)
;; |
;; | (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'bbdb/send-hook) ; If you use Gnus
;; |
;; | (add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'bbdb/send-hook) ; For other mailers
;; |                                            ; (VM, Rmail)
;;
;; Then, each time a message is sent, the user is asked if the
;; addresses of recipients should be added to the database.
;; The addresses matching bbdb-user-mail-names are never added.
;; The variables bbdb/news-auto-create-p and
;; bbdb-ignore-some-messages-alist are taken in account the same way
;; as for adding senders when recieving messages.
;;
;; Cf. customize-group bbdb-noticing-records RET to get more
;; information about this.

;;  for mailers other than Gnus.
;; version 1.3   (12/03/02)
;;  - Bug fix : "Name, christian name" <address@host.com> are now managed correctly.
;; version 1.2.3 (5/03/02)
;;  - Documentation fix : this material works only for Gnus, and not VM :-(
;; version 1.2.2 (5/02/02)
;;  - Bug fix : Changed a setq to a let.
;; Version 1.2.1 (1/02/02)
;;  - Rename `remove-nil-from-list' to avoid name clubbering.
;;
;; Version 1.2 (29/01/02)
