This directory contains 3rd party packages I use in my configuration and I had
to install manually (i.e. with no help of ELPA).


* I put this files under revision control because it is easier to keep an
  up to date folder online, and synchronize my .emacs.d.

 
* The packages in this folder are NOT my own packages/config files, and most of
  the time are not even sync'ed with their respective upstreams.  I update them
  when I need so for my private usage.
