;;; Commentary
;;
;; This file provides org-protocol handlers and various hacks to
;; produce a nicely centered, pop-up remember frame for links passed
;; to emacsclient by the org-mac-protocol suite of AppleScripts. It
;; also defines new org-mode hyperlink types for opening files in
;; various OS X applications.

;;; Installation and Usage
