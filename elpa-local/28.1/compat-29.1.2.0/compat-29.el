Here's some example key sequences.

However, if the optional second argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is

in the current keymaps.  However, if the optional third argument
NO-REMAP is non-nil, `keymap-lookup' returns the unmapped
command.

If KEY is a key sequence initiated with the mouse, the used keymaps
will depend on the clicked mouse position with regard to the buffer
and possible local keymaps on strings.

If the optional argument POSITION is non-nil, it specifies a mouse
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the lookup

:suppress  If non-nil, the keymap will be suppressed (see `suppress-keymap').

:parent    If non-nil, this should be a keymap to use as the parent

:keymap    If non-nil, instead of creating a new keymap, the given keymap

:name      If non-nil, this should be a string to use as the menu for

:prefix    If non-nil, this should be a symbol to be used as a prefix

The `:repeat' keyword can also be specified; it controls the
`repeat-mode' behavior of the bindings in the keymap.  When it is
non-nil, all commands in the map will have the `repeat-map'
symbol property.

More control is available over which commands are repeatable; the
value can also be a property list with properties `:enter' and
`:exit', for example:

     :repeat (:enter (commands ...) :exit (commands ...))

`:enter' specifies the list of additional commands that only
enter `repeat-mode'.  When the list is empty, then by default all
commands in the map enter `repeat-mode'.  This is useful when
there is a command that has the `repeat-map' symbol property, but
doesn't exist in this specific map.  `:exit' is a list of
commands that exit `repeat-mode'.  When the list is empty, no
commands in the map exit `repeat-mode'.  This is useful when a
command exists in this specific map, but it doesn't have the
`repeat-map' symbol property on its symbol.
