;;; Commentary:

;; This is the part of my init files devoted to automatic text
;; insertion. It configures facilities like update of copyright notes
;; and time-stamps, Yasnippet and auto-insert.


;;; Markers for template filling
(setq template-marker-for-name  ">>>NAME<<<" )
(setq template-marker-for-email ">>>EMAIL<<<")
(setq template-marker-for-point ">>>POINT<<<")
(setq template-marker-for-time  ">>>TIME<<<")
(setq template-time-format      "%Y-%02m-%02d, %A %02H:%02M:%02S (%Z)")  ;; Time format similar with time-stamp one.


;;; Auto Insert:

(require 'autoinsert)
(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'auto-insert)  ;;; Adds hook to find-files-hook
(setq auto-insert-directory "~/config/emacs/templates/") ;; Template's files folder, *NOTE* Trailing slash important
(setq auto-insert-query nil) ;;; If you don't want to be prompted before insertion

;;; Auto Insert rules:

;(define-auto-insert "\.sh" "sh-template.sh") ; Example of a template file based rule.
(define-auto-insert 'sh-mode ["sh-template.sh" apply-template-marker]) ; Example of a template file based rule.


;;; YaSnippet

(require 'yasnippet)
(if (file-directory-p (concat default-elisp-path "/snippets/"))
    (add-to-list 'yas/root-directory (concat default-elisp-path "/snippets/")) ;; Snippet's file folder. 
  )
;; Map `yas/load-directory' to every element
(mapc 'yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)
(setq yas/ignore-filenames-as-triggers t)


;;; Copyright update --- setup in custom.el

;;; Time-Stamp update --- setup in custom.el
