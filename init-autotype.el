;;; Commentary:

;; This is the part of my init files devoted to automatic text
;; insertion. It configures facilities like update of copyright notes
;; and time-stamps, Yasnippet and auto-insert.


;;; Auto Insert:

(require 'autoinsert)
(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'auto-insert)  ;;; Adds hook to find-files-hook
(setq auto-insert-directory "~/config/emacs/templates/") ;; Template's files folder, *NOTE* Trailing slash important
(setq auto-insert-query nil) ;;; If you don't want to be prompted before insertion

;;; Auto Insert rules:

;(define-auto-insert "\.sh" "sh-template.sh") ; Example of a template file based rule.
(define-auto-insert 'sh-mode "sh-template.sh") ; Example of a template file based rule.


;;; YaSnippet

(require 'yasnippet)
(setq yas/root-directory 
      (list "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/yasnippet/snippets/"
            (concat default-elisp-path "/snippets/")))   ;; Snippet's file folder. 
;; Map `yas/load-directory' to every element
(mapc 'yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)
(setq yas/ignore-filenames-as-triggers t)
